    "* Assess situation: Determine resources availability, project requirements, assess risks and contingencies, and conduct a cost-benefit analysis.\n",
    "* Determine data mining goals: In addition to defining the business objectives, you should also define what success looks like from a technical data mining perspective.\n",
    "* Produce project plan: Select technologies and tools and define detailed plans for each project phase."

    "* Describe data: Examine the data and document its surface properties like data format, number of records, or field identities.\n",
    "* Explore data: Dig deeper into the data. Query it, visualize it, and identify relationships among the data.\n",
    "* Verify data quality: How clean/dirty is the data? Document any quality issues."

    "* Select data: Determine which data sets will be used and document reasons for inclusion/exclusion.\n",
    "* Clean data: Often this is the lengthiest task. Without it, you’ll likely fall victim to garbage-in, garbage-out. A common practice during this task is to correct, impute, or remove erroneous values.\n",
    "* Construct data: Derive new attributes that will be helpful. For example, derive someone’s body mass index from height and weight fields.\n",
    "* Integrate data: Create new data sets by combining data from multiple sources.\n",
    "* Format data: Re-format data as necessary. For example, you might convert string values that store numbers to numeric values so that you can perform mathematical operations."
